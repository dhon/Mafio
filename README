APP
This is a small program for the party game Mafia.
It is very simple to run, npm install & npm start in root folder.
The application is hosted on localhost:3000 in your web browser.
Do not use the Nav Bar if playing game, it was for testing purposes.
It is basically the same as my other mafia application except more bare-bones using only Node, Express, and Angular.

GAME
The objective of the game is simple: The Mafia try to kill the Town, and the Town try to kill the Mafia.
I hard-coded the player to be unable to die in the night and cannot start a vote on themselves.
This means it is impossible for the player to lose as Mafia, and less likely as Town.
This is very stupid game design, but RNG dying is probably worse.

SETUP
The game has 1 cop, 1 medic, 3 vanilla, and 2 mafia.
(If Alive) The cop checks one person every night and tells the player which team they are on.
(If Alive) The medic saves one person every night, if the mafia tried to kill them they survive.
(If Alive) Vanilla do nothing special. They are members of the town and vote on formals.
(If Alive) Mafia try to kill a member of the town during the night. Mafia get 1 kill total even if both alive.

PHASES
Night Phase: Night Actions are performed.
Day Phase: Nominate a player to be voted on.
Vote Phase: Vote a player to live / die.
Log Phase: Shows what players voted during Vote Phase.
Results Phase: Shows which team won and the roles of players.

VICTORY CONDITIONS
Town wins if all mafia are dead.
Mafia wins if Town no longer has majority. This is because in a real game mafia would then never vote on each other and are thus unable to be lynched.
